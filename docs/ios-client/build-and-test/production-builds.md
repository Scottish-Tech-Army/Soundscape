# Production Builds

The soundscape app uses [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) for creating builds and distributing them to TestFlight.

## Running lanes

Every time you run fastlane, use `bundle exec fastlane [lane]`.

## Updating fastlane

To update fastlane, just run `bundle update fastlane` from the `ios` directory.
